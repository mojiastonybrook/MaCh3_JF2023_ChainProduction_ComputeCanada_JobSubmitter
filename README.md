# MaCh3 Jonit Fit 2023 Chain Production on ComputeCanada with the JobSubmitter

The codes are used to create the necessary job scripts, run scripts and inputs for the massive production of MCMC chains with MaCh3, especially on the Cedar cluster of ComputeCanada. For efficiency we would like to have mulitple individual chains produced in parallel. For each chain there should be a specific configuration card assigned with it indicating the setups of that certain chain. A template of the config should be provided by the user in oreder to set up the common settings for the chains. As for the special setting of a certain chain, for example the save name of the final output file, it would be handled by the codes. The execuable from MaCh3 to produce a Markov chain would be called in a so-called RunScript; the RunScript are submitted to and executed by the cluster via a so-called SubmitScript. The templates of RunScripts and SubmitScripts should also be provided by the user and the contents would then be modified automaticaly by the codes according to the user-defined needs.
